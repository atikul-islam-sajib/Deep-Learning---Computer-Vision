# Deep-Learning---Computer-Vision

ALL THE PROJECTS ARE IN THE FOLDER NAMED `Deep Learning - Computer Vision Using CNN & OpenCV`. SOME OF THE CRUCIAL PROJECTS THAT I AM GOING TO MENTIONED HERE. REST OF THE OTHERS FIND IN THAT CERTAIN FOLDER.HAVE A LOOK.

This is the domain of Computer Vision where the projects built with CNN architecture, RCNN, Fast RCNN, Faster RCNN, Yolo with its version, and OpenCV.


Latest Project was Polyp Detection with 3000 datasets that downloaded from Roboflow. This was trained with Yolo version 5, custom training. The mPA score is above 89%.

The link of this project is given below:

This is the project named X-ray classification for the disease named Pneumenia. The approach that I used in CNN architecture, for instance, own architecture, Pre trained model, for example, VGG16, ResNet, InceptionNet. In this pretrained model, the approach that I used is Feature Extraction and Fine Tuning. Then I used the OpenCV model to do the object Detection.
