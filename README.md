# Deep-Learning---Computer-Vision
This is the domain of Computer Vision where the projects built with CNN architecture, RCNN, Fast RCNN, Faster RCNN, Yolo with its version, and OpenCV.


Latest Project was Polyp Detection with 3000 datasets that downloaded from Roboflow. This was trained with Yolo version 5, custom training. The mPA score is above 89%.

The link of this project is given below:
